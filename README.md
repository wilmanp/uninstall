# uninstall

This script is used to uninstall any local n-Lab Data Foundations study.
You just need to run the file in the terminal and enter the name of the study that you'd like to delete.
This script will delete 3 main things:
- Enviroments folder in the miniconda directory
- Desktop launcher(if exists)
- Installation script(if exists)

Once you run this script, files deleted by the script will not be able to recover, so be caucious when using it.
